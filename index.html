    <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>

    <p>Snoopy got a bowl of milk.</p>

    <p>Woodstock was snoring so loud, that he was drowning out the storm, and poor Snoopy was unable to go back to sleep.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, indoors, Charlie Brown was staring into the storm. In his mind the rolling thunder clouds and pouring rain were not a storm but his inner ennui.</p>
